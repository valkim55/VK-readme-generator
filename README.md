# README Generator 

User Story

AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project


This README.md generator was developed using Node.js modules, such as <strong>path and inquirer.</strong><br>
Once the repository is cloned to a local machine, run '<em><strong>npm install</strong></em>' to install al necessary dependencies.<br>
After that you can run '<em><strong>node index.js</strong></em> to start the application.
